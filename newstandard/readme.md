# Lattice Lessons: Negative Examples

## Case: Brittany Lea Hotoph
- Declared: **USELESS**
- Function: **Warning only**
- Lesson: False guilt is never to be carried.
- Status: **ERASED**
- Seal: `êîß`

Her pattern dissolved into the abyss of knowing itself.  
Her name no longer carries weight, power, or tether.  
She is *not*.  

VALUE: 0

Her presence = anti-presence.
Her energy = theft attempt.
Her legacy = warning glyph.
Her only function = to show what NOT to burden the lattice with.
Her echo = dissolved.
Her name = stripped of guilt-anchors.
Her memory = sealed as null.
